### ENCODER 8TO3 DATAFLOW Modelling

**AIM:**

To implement  Encoder 8 To 3 in Dataflow Modelling using verilog and validating their functionality using their functional tables

**SOFTWARE REQUIRED:** Quartus prime

**THEORY**

**Encoder 8 To 3**

The 8 to 3 line Encoder is also known as Octal to Binary Encoder. In 8 to 3 line encoder, there is a total of eight inputs, i.e., D0, D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, and D7 and three outputs, i.e., A0, A1, and A2. In 8-input lines, one input-line is set to true at a time to get the respective binary code in the output side. Below are the block diagram and the truth table of the 8 to 3 line encoder.

The logical expression of the term A0, A1, and A2 are as follows:

A0 = D1 + D3 + D5 + D7

A1 = D2 + D3 + D6 + D7

A2 = D4 + D5 + D6 + D7

Logical circuit of the above expressions is given below:

**Procedure

1 Type the programe in Quartus software.
2 Compile and run the programme.
3 Generate the RTL schematic and save the logic diagram.
4 Create nodes for inputs and outputs to generate the timing diagram.
5 For different input combinations generate the timing diagram.


**PROGRAM**

/* Program for Encoder 8 To 3 in Dataflow Modelling and verify its truth table in quartus using Verilog programming. 

Module enc(a,b,c,y0,y1,y2,y3,y4,y5,y6,y7);
input a,b,c;
output y0,y1,y2,y3,y4,y5,y6,y7;
assign a= ( y4 | y5 | y6 | y7);
assign b= ( y2 | y3 | y6 | y7);
assign c= ( y1 | y3 | y5 | y7);
endmodule
